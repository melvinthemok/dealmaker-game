# Dealmaker

A game of negotiation between an Investor and the Target over the price of a stake in the latter.

Each game lasts a random number of rounds. Before the actual negotiation over price, the Investor gets to seek secret data points from the Target, which will each adjust the price. The actual value is known to the Target but not the Investor.

The Investor can then make up to 3 offers, which the Target may accept or reject. Points are then allocated mainly depending on the difference between final price paid and actual value.
